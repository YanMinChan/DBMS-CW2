9. How many movies have more female actors than male actors?
10. Based on ratings with 10,000 or more votes, what is the top movie genre using the average rank per movie genre as the metric? (Note: where a higher value for rank is considered a better movie)

12. How many movies have an actor/actress that also wrote and directed the movie?
